review Thinkful guidelines for project

Render ShimmerList within <main> tag for each list

HIDE_FORM and SHOW_FORM change to HIDE_MAIN SHOW_MAIN
better --> HIDE_ELEMENT('main') SHOW_ELEMENT('main')


Does error handling work for delete, post, and patch?

*might have to break up modal messages, perhaps one set for success actions, another for fail actions which will then redirect accordingly (success actions keep user on page, fail actions redirect to previous page)

NO RESULTS
*Make NoResults component with prop 'data' 
Component is <h2>`No ${props.data} found`</h2>
