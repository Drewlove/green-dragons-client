*DEV PROCESS
1. API: 
git checkout -b dev/feature-name
Write code, including new table, seeding table, and changes to router and service
Make sure the new endpoint works on Postman
push changes to git
push changes to heroku 

2. Client:
git checkout -b dev/feature-name
Make sure the remotely hosted API endpoint can be correctly accessed by the client
Once working, push changes to git
Push changes to zeit

Next: 
Move onto API tests

THEN, go table by table (Challenges, Community, Subcommunity) implement getting lists, and forms with 
HTTP methods for forms, using user profile as a template

The task below will require a restructuring of FormContainer, or perhaps another parent container
THEN, work with user related data, user challenges, use rcommunities and user transactions

Finish by next Sunday
*Might have to leave out leader board, could take too much time to implement
*Can always go back and put it in later, after you have finished the course
